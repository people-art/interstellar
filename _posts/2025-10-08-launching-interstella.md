Welcome to the Interstella project! Inspired by the epic sci-fi film *Interstellar*, we're embarking on a journey to explore the "token cosmos" within large language models (LLMs). Our goal is to enable traversals through semantic black holes, fostering emergent AGI capabilities through mathematical rigor.

## Project Overview

Interstella combines differential geometry, random dynamical systems, and engineering pipelines to model and simulate leaps from known knowledge manifolds to novel insights. Think of it as plotting a course through the event horizon of uncertainty to reach AHA moments.

### Key Components
- **Geometric Model**: Using the Fisher information metric to define distances in semantic space.
- **Probabilistic Traversals**: Freidlin-Wentzell theory for rare event probabilities.
- **Pipeline**: A five-layer system for navigation and verification.

## First Steps

We've set up the initial framework and run simulations on toy models. Check out the [research page](/research.html) for details and [demos](/demos.html) for visualizations.

## Ethical Considerations

As we push boundaries towards AGI emergence, safety and alignment are paramount. Discussions on risks are in the [paper outline](/paper.html).

Stay tuned for updates on submissions to NeurIPS 2025 and more code releases.
